            <div class="text">
                Web design is a crucial aspect of creating an online presence, blending aesthetics with functionality to craft a user-friendly experience. It involves a balance of visula elements, such as layout, colors, and typography, alongside practical features like navigation, load speed, and mobile responsiveness. Effective web design aims to meet the need of user, guiding them intuitively through the site while ensuring content is accessible and engaging. Additionally, it incorporates best practices for search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility, ensuring that the site is easily discoverable and usable by a broad audiance. Ultimately, a well-designed website enhances user satisfaction and achieves business goals.

            <div class="txt1 tt">
                Effective web design requires you to understand the basic artistic principles you can leverage to make your designs more appealing. If you've ever taken an art class, the following fundamentals might look familiar, though applying them to web design is slightly different.
            </div>

            <div class="subt1 ss">
                <dl>
                    <dt style="color:#9ba278;">@ Line</dt>
                    <dd >
                        Every letter, border, and division in a web page layout is made up of lines that form the larger structure. As you learn web design, you'll learn how to use lines to create order and balance. For example, you might create borders to separate elements on a page or horizontal lines to bookend paragraphs.
                    </dd>

                    <dt style="color:#bd8b7b">@ Shapes</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The three basic shapes in visual design are squares, circles, and triangles. Squares and rectangles work well for blocks of content, circles for buttons, and triangles for icons that accompany important messages or calls-to-action (CTAs). 

                        Shapes also evoke specific associations — squares with strength, circles with harmony and comfort, and triangles with importance and action.
                    </dd>
                
                    <dt style="color:#a0739c">@ Texture</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Texture replicates something in the real world. Through texture, we understand whether something is rough or smooth. 

                        You'll notice textures throughout popular web designs, from paperlike backgrounds to the colorful wisps of a Gaussian blur. Thoughtfully using texture can make your designs more interesting and give them a sense of physicality.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt style="color: #7382a4;">@ Color</dt>
                    <dd>
                        To create sites that aren't an eye strain, educate yourself on color theory. Understanding the color wheel, complementary colors, contrasting tones, and the emotions that different ones evoke means you can more strategically design your site. 

                        A huge part of learning front-end web design is knowing what color combinations look good together — generate ideas by creating a few palettes with a tool like Coolors.

            <div class="txt2 tt">
                HTML determines how a website's content, images, navigation, and other elements display in a browser. Though you don't need to be an expert in HTML to become a web developer, it helps to be familiar with how it works, even if you're using a visual-based design platform like Webflow. 

                HTML tags are the instructions a browser uses to generate a website. These tags control headings, paragraphs, links, and images. You'll especially want to know how header tags like H1s, H2s, and H3s create content hierarchy. In addition to affecting layout structure, header tags help web crawlers classify a site, which affects where your site lands in organic search rankings.

        <div id="rty">
            <div class="head3 hh">Understand CSS</div>
            <div class="txt3 tt">
                CSS provides styling instructions for HTML elements. Applying fonts, adding padding, setting alignment, and choosing colors are all possible through CSS. Knowing how this styling works gives you the skills to create unique-looking websites and customize existing templates.
            
            <div style="height:20px;"></div>
            
                A CSS class is a list of attributes that come together to style elements. For example,
               
            <div style="height:20px;"></div>
             
            <div>p {</div>
            <div>color:red;</div>
            <div>}</div>

            <div style="height:20px;"></div>

            <div>
                The “p” at the beginning refers to the paragraph HTML tag used to create paragraphs. When you give them the “color: red” attribute, every letter in every paragraph on your pages will appear red. You can style any complete HTML element this way, or you can create classes that you apply to specific elements, like:
            </div>

            <div style="height:20px;"></div>

            <div>.red-text {</div>
            <div>color:red;</div>
            <div>}</div>

            <div style="height:20px;"></div>

            <div>
                The above text with class "red-text" would appear red in this example, but other paragraphs on your site would remain unaffected.

            <div class="txt4 tt">
                Beginners in web development often confuse UI and UX. In short, UX covers how users experience your site — whether they find it straightforward to navigate, if the visuals are intriguing, how they feel as they journey through it. UI focuses on a site's interactivity, complementing the UX designer's user-focused goals to ensure the site “hits.”

                <div style="height:20px;"></div>

                Here are a few fundamental UX principles you'll need to consider.
            </div>

            <div class="subt2 ss">

                    <dt style="color:#9ba278;">@ User personas</dt>
                    <dd >
                        Web design means understanding end users. You'll conduct target audience research, create user personas, and figure out how to use this information to optimize a design for an audience's needs.
                    </dd>

                    <dt style="color:#bd8b7b">@ Information architecture</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Without clear organization, people will get confused and leave your site. Information architecture and content mapping provide a blueprint for how each section of the website works together to give a straightforward customer journey.
                    </dd>
                
                    <dt style="color:#a0739c">@ User flows</dt>
                    <dd>
                        User flows plot how people move through a design. They help you prioritize the most critical sections and ensure people can access them seamlessly.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt style="color: #7382a4;">@ Wireframes</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Wireframes show where headings, text, visuals, forms, and other elements will be located on a web page. Even if you're building a simple one-page web design, mapping out a wireframe gives you a solid guide to work from. Wireframes are essential to creating a consistent experience and structuring layouts as you move on to more complex UX designs. 
                    </dd>       
                
                    <dt style="color: #de818a;">@ Prototyping</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Prototypes represent a functioning web design. Images, interactions, content, and other essential elements replicate the real-world design. Then, these mockups are sent to a test group of users who give feedback on the UX.

                <div>
                    UI work includes all the mechanisms that put a piece of technology into action. A doorknob is a user interface, as is the volume control on your car radio. Just as buttons and knobs enable users to interact with machines, user interface elements on a website allow people to put actions into motion.
                </div>

                <div style="height:20px;"></div>

                <div>
                    Interacting and engaging with a website should be consistent and follow repeatable patterns. Users landing on a site should immediately understand how to navigate it, so the controls must appear obvious in their functionality. 
                </div>

                <div style="height:20px;"></div>

                <div>
                    Whether minimizing the number of navigational options, making the checkout process quicker, or integrating interactive elements that increase accessibility, understanding UI best practices streamlines how people interact with your website.

            <div class="txt6 tt">
                People latch onto familiar design patterns, making for an accessible route through a site. You likely intuitively know where to look because you've seen these patterns before. So, understanding common web design patterns helps you create websites that flow smoothly. 

                <div style="height:20px;"></div>

                Z-patterns and F-patterns are the most common reading paths on sites.

                    <dd >
                        For layouts with generous amounts of negative space, such as landing pages, the Z-pattern is an efficient way to cruise through a website. When you start paying attention to where your eyes are going through a design, you'll immediately recognize when a Z-pattern is in place.
                    </dd>

                    <dt style="color:#bd8b7b">@ F-Pattern</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Designs heavy on text, like for an online publication or blog, often follow a distinct F-pattern. On the left side is a list of articles or posts, and the relevant information is in the main body of the page. Optimize this pattern to give people all information they need, even at a glance.
                    </dd>

                        Along with understanding layout patterns, it's also essential to know the fundamentals behind responsive web design. A responsive web design has a consistent look no matter what device users display it on.

                        Serif typefaces have minuscule lines (known as serifs) that decorate each letter.

                        ans serif typefaces lack the identifying lines of serif typefaces.

                    <dd>
                        Display typefaces are often used for headlines and can be either large and impactful or made of sharp, thin lines. They usually have sophisticated letterforms and are meant to grab attention.

                You can watch tutorials, read blog posts, enroll in free web design courses, and absorb all the theory and information you want about web design, but the best way to become a web designer is to begin designing.

                <div style="height:20px;"></div>

                Start with a simple project like a blog. Creating one gives you practical design experience as you learn how to use a content management system. Plus, blogs are popular with clients looking to increase their website rankings in search results, so you can use this initial design to practice crafting something you'll likely do often.
